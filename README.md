# Odin_Recipes_Project
This project is to build a simple HTML website that shows off some of Grandma's recipes
I'm using my now-since passed Grandmother's recipes for ravioli dough, tomato sauce, and meatballs as a practice project.
I guarantee that none of these recipes will taste anything like what my grandmother made. She had 60+ years of making these dishes and she certainly
didn't need to think about how to make them before she made them. Add far more salt,pepper,and butter than you think you need to make it taste good!.

This project is a practice project for my work with the Odin Project. So, if you think it sucks, it probably does! thank you for reading.
